## Motivation.
In some situation, you have trained the Tensorflow model and save model file in .pb format. However, in other situations, the necessary model file format is .ckpt. Thus, this project is designed to help you convert .pb model file into .ckpt model file.

## Usage.
Modify the pb_file_path and ckpt_file_path in the script.

Then, run the following script to start converting.

	python convert_pb2ckpt.py
