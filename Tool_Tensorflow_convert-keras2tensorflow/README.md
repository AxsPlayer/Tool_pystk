## Motivation.
In some situation, you would use Keras to train the model, but in engineer environment, what would be used is Java Based Tensorflow. Therefore, the Keras model should be converted into Tensorflow model. This project aims to convert Keras model file into Tensorflow model file.

## Usage.
Modify the input file path and output file path in the script, according to your specific situation.

Then, run the script, with following script:

	python keras2tensorflow.py
